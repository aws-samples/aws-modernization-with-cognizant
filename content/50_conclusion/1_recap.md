### Congratulations 

Well Done! With your help we have successfully demonstrated to Mythical Mysfits team, how to orchestrate their Testing in DevOps and enable earlier defect detection and higher-quality deployments.  

You have successfully completed the **“Test Automation in DevOps”** workshop, embracing quality assurance across the lifecycle. 




### We have accomplished

In this workshop, we have built, fixed and executed the Continuous Testing pipeline. Along with this hands-on implementation, you now also have a high-level understanding on testing in DevOps, including various testing stages, their objectives, challenges, enablers and some industry best practices.  

As committed in the 'In-Store for Practitioners' section, we have discussed the answers to the following questions in this workshop :

-	Why QA is integral to a successful DevOps implementation
-	How testing for DevOps is different than traditional testing
-	What various types and stages of testing are essential for end-to-end quality assurance
-	How to build and execute the continuous testing pipeline
-	What are the various tooling alternatives, enablers and best practices in testing for DevOps
-	How to integrate open-source tools based automation suits with the  pipeline
-	How to fix typical issues and fix your continuous testing pipeline
