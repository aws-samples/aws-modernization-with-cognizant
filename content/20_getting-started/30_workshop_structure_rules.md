- **Scope**: For this workshop, we will focus on the execution stage of the testing pipeline and not the complete testing life cycle.
- **Modular Structure**: This workshop constitutes of five modules that explain a continuous testing pipeline in a chronological sequence. Each module provides an overview, relevant concepts and practices, before getting into the pipeline execution. In order to get the best out this workshop, we recommend you to follow the sequence and build your pipeline in progression. 

- **Solve and Learn**: We have induced few defects in the application code and test assets, so that you can debug and fix them to gain a more practical insight into this workshop.

- **Possibilities Infinitum**: There is no one right way to test an application. For this workshop, we have made a few broad assumptions for our testing approach, pipeline orchestration, tools and frameworks.

- **Meet Tikk!**: The over-enthusiastic, effervescent and self-confessed testing geek. Tikk is your assistant for this workshop. In the section - ‘Tikk Talk’, Tikk shares interesting info like - alternative approaches, practitioner tips, best practices, industry trends and trivia.
